This is an optical illusion, but it's a fascinating experience. Just a short distance away is Gurudwara Pathar Sahib, a beautiful Sikh temple maintained by the Indian Army. It is believed that Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism, rested here during his journey to Tibet. The Gurudwara houses a sacred rock with an imprint believed to be of Guru Nanak's back.",
