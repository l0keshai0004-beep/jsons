I encountered an error when trying to fetch hotel information using the `hotel_tool`. It seems there was a bad request. I will proceed with generating the itinerary and other details based on the information you provided, but I won't be able to include specific hotel recommendations or their associated costs.

Could you please double-check the hotel search parameters or provide alternative options if you'd like me to try searching for hotels again? In the meantime, I will generate the rest of the itinerary.
