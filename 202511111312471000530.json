          "description": "Patan Durbar Square, located in the heart of the city of Lalitpur, is a marvel of Newar architecture. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this square is densely packed with ancient palaces, temples, and shrines, all noted for their exquisite carvings. The former royal palace complex is the center of Patan's religious and social life and houses a museum containing a fine collection of bronze statues and religious objects. Compared to Kathmandu's Durbar Square, Patan is often considered more spacious and less crowded, making it a more relaxed environment for exploration.",
          "whyVisit": "This is a perfect final activity, offering a deep dive into Nepal's artistic heritage. The open square is great for your child to explore, and the stunning architecture provides a beautiful backdrop for final family photos. Its relatively compact nature makes it manageable before heading to the airport.",
